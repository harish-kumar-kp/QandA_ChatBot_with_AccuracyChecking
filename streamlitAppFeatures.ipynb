The process begins with inhalation, where air enters through the nose or mouth, traveling down the trachea and into the bronchi, which branch into smaller bronchioles within the lungs. These end in alveoli, small air sacs where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide diffuses out to be exhaled. The diaphragm, a muscle under the lungs, contracts during inhalation and relaxes during exhalation, facilitating airflow. This system works closely with the circulatory system to ensure that all cells receive the oxygen they need for energy production.\"\"\",\n",

It includes organs such as the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Digestion starts in the mouth, where enzymes in saliva begin breaking down carbohydrates. The food then moves down the esophagus to the stomach, where acids and enzymes further digest it. The partially digested food passes into the small intestine, where most nutrient absorption occurs, aided by enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver. The large intestine absorbs water and forms waste, which is excreted through the rectum.

Detail: The urinary system removes waste products from the body and maintains fluid and electrolyte balance. It includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys filter blood to remove waste and excess substances, forming urine. This urine flows through the ureters to the bladder, where it is stored until excretion through the urethra. This system also regulates blood pressure and pH balance by adjusting the amount of water and electrolytes in the blood. It plays a critical role in homeostasis and maintaining the body's internal environment.\"\"\",\n",

Detail: The integumentary system includes the skin, hair, nails, and glands. The skin, the body’s largest organ, serves as a protective barrier against external threats like pathogens, physical injury, and UV radiation. It also regulates temperature through sweating and blood flow adjustments. The skin contains sensory receptors that allow for the sensation of touch, pain, and temperature. Hair and nails protect and support the skin, while glands in the skin produce sweat for temperature regulation and sebum to keep the skin moisturized. This system is vital for protection, temperature regulation, and sensory perception.\"\"\",\n",
